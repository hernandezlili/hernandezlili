- Hi, I'm Lili a Frontend development and Graphic designer based in Cancún, Mexico. 
- Throughout the years, I’ve been practicing and perfecting many different 
- disciplines and areas of digital experience design such as UI/UX, web design, 
- branding and identity, packing design, but I found my passion as a web development. 
- I enjoy the trip of design something and then make it real through the code.
